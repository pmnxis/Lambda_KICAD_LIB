Lambda Series Kicad6 Lib
```
Welcome to ES&EE CAT Ph.D Lambda λ 's Lab.
The KICAD library used and drawn by cat, her name is Lambda λ
Recent days, λ is trying to use KICAD. And she decided to share some libraries for public.
```

## Transition to Kicad7
Now This library changed to Kicad7 version.
Some of library would working with Kicad6, But latest library only working with Kicad7.
Previous kicad5 library is legacy format. Thus apply new libary format.

## Update schedule.
If there's new part using in KICAD from my job or hobby. It will be update asap.

## Required Parameters for SchLib.
Some rules are applied on schlib.

## Note for 3d Model Owner
Some 3d model files are downloaded from other website. Original designer's name will be writen.

The path of each model's reference info is in "LAMBDA_LIB_DIR/3DShapes/**/*.Ref.txt"


## Add "LAMBDA_LIB_DIR" PATH on Kicad Configuration.
![License_img](./Etc/addLambdaPath.png)
Kicad >> Preferences >> Configure Paths..

Click '+' and add LAMBDA_LIB_DIR for name, and Path is root of this git.

There's problem kicad cannot associate 3d model with relative path from kicad footprint path.


## Why don't you upload on official library git.
I have different guidelines and I consider for the BOM based on JLCPCB and Korean turnkey services.
So some parameters can be useful for your works or not.

## License
![License_img](./Etc/License.jpg)
Free for commercial and Non-commercial usage. But you can give Churu(ちゅ~る) to λ. She draw libary for my work. and test those library with SMT and fabrication.
